# Flight_Fare_Prediction

In this project, I will be analyzing the flight fare prediction using Machine Learning dataset using essential exploratory data analysis techniques then will draw some predictions about the price of the flight based on some features such as what type of airline it is, what is the arrival time, what is the departure time, what is the duration of the flight, source, destination and more.
# About Dataset
We have 2 datasets here — training set and test set.

The training set contains the features, along with the prices of the flights. It contains 10683 records, 10 input features and 1 output column — ‘Price’.

The test set contains 2671 records and 10 input features. The output ‘Price’ column needs to be predicted in this set. We will use Regression techniques here, since the predicted output will be a continuous value.

Following is the features available in the dataset – Airline, Date_of_Journey, Source, Destination, Route, Dep_Time, Arrival_Time ,Duration, Total_Stops, Additional_Info, Price.

# All the Lifecycle In A Data Science Project is divided into four parts:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Feature Engineering
3. Feature selection
4. Model Deployment
